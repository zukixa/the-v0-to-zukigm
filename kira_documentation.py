# permission system, all commands can bee done by anyone which is *not a good idea* ---> done in _tmw/_mod

# audit-log - having bot post out every action done by anyone in an assigned channel --> the process began in kira.py
# help messages depending on error in using commands --> somewhat in progress with try/except funnies
# encryption system
